+ TRC is now fully ignored. Just made everything worse
+ Individual episode support (read *notes*)
+ Finally more user-friendly embed information (as long as it's there)
  + This makes the item lists so fucking huge that I had to increase the request timeout. *just letting you know*
+ WOW more CPU cycles to burn for the least practical reasons imaginable
  + well at least I read up on Dockerfiles, so those images are going to be smaller now
