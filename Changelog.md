##### Since this project is actually being used right now, I decided to make it a little more user friendly.

**Changes:**
+ fixed a few messages
+ implemented system to error checking while initiating a channel
+ added function to warn and pause a failing connection, or remove it when the channel doesn't exist anymore

Info: I thought emby would require a few edits, but it seems like it was an available option all along.


I still don't recommend anyone to use this.
